To compile:
  
   -Download Eigen source code from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
   
   -Create a New Project and include the Eigen folder 
   
  -Clone this repository inside your new project

Additional Info:

  The operators have not been overloaded, but if this is a problem because it does not match with Eigen style, please let me know.
