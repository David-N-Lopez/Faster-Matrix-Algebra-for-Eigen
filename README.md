# Faster-Matrix-Algebra-for-EIGEN
Test - David Nicolas Lopez

Faster Matrix Algebra for Eigen's linear algebra library. Reduced the computational time by reduced by 43\% by implementing symmetrical matrix algebra.

To compile:
  
   -Download Eigen source code from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
   
   -Create a New Project and include the Eigen folder 
   
  -Clone this repository inside your new project
  
  -Run Test.cpp using either clang or gcc
